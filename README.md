# SegmentationOfBloodVesselsUsing_PCA_CNN
This project focuses on accurately segmenting retinal blood vessels from fundus images. It uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for preprocessing to enhance image contrast and reduce dimensionality, followed by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for precise vessel detection. The system is trained and evaluated on the DRIVE dataset.
